## Chapter I. Preamble

In the last project, we discussed about what ML is and what problems this area of science solves. 
And also a detailed series of examples of the most difficult tasks, and by what group they can be divided. 
The goal of the open project is one of this group and will get acquainted with the first child - a linear model.

But before we start, I would like to briefly describe how they usually approach the description of all tools. 
Further, we will consider the formulation of the problem from a mathematical point of view. 
And the main tool for solving these statements will be the following algorithm:

We limit the pool of possible solutions to a certain set (set of functions).

For example, we want to predict temperature y from pressure x with only 1 observation. 
We restrict ourselves to the set of linear functions:

$$y \approx \hat{y}=f(x)=wx$$

As a rule, each solution in this set can be uniquely determined using parameters..
In our example, this is the parameter *a*

We choose a loss function that clearly demonstrates our desire to find a solution that satisfies the goal of the problem.

In our example, this will be the standard deviation, which takes on high values if our prediction is far from the true value..

$$L \left( y, \hat{y} \right) = \left( y - \hat{y} \right)^2$$

Thus, the search for our optimal solution will be reduced to finding a solution for which the loss function is minimal. 
But since the function will depend on the parameter, we can say that the goal is to find such parameters for which the loss 
function is minimal.

In our example, formally the task will sound like this:

$$\arg \min_{\hat{y}} L \left( y, \hat{y} \right) = \arg \min_{w} L(y, wx)$$

The fact that the loss function depends on the parameters will allow us to calculate the derivatives and 
use optimization methods (including gradient descent) to find the optimal values for the parameters

In our example:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}=-2w(y-wx)=0 \Rightarrow w=\lbrace \frac{y}{x}, 0 \rbrace$$

Often it will be possible to look at the same problem mathematically from a different angle by solving 
it in an alternative formulation. This will open up new meanings in the solution, which will help you understand 
the details even better. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you do not dwell on the materials mentioned in this 
course and periodically improve your understanding of one or another approach.

In this chapter we will discuss regression problems limiting the pool of possible solutions with linear models. 
Together with the model itself we consider things that are closely related to the model development process: 
definitions of overfitting/underfitting, how to handle these and how to estimate the quality of models.

## Chapter II. Introduction

### Regression problem

Suppose we have a set of inputs *X*  which are corresponded to outputs *y*. 
The goal is to find a mapping function f from *X* to *y*. 
In regression problems $`y ‚àà R`$ and our $`X ‚àà R^n`$. In other words:

$$f: X \rightarrow y, \text{ where } y \in \mathbb{R} \text{ is a target, } X \text{ is training data }$$

There are a lot of examples for real-world regression problems. Let‚Äôs consider the most popular:
* Predict the age of a viewer watching TV or video channels.
* Predict amplitude, frequency and other characteristics of heartbeat
* Predict the required amount of taxies due to specific weather conditions
* Predict the temperature at any location inside a building using weather data, time, door sensors, etc.

In case of linear regression the key property is that the expected value of the output is assumed to be a linear 
function of the input, $$f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b$$ . This makes the model easy to fit the data and easy to interpret. 

For regression, the most common choice is to use quadratic loss, or $`l2`$ loss, or MSE ‚Äì mean squared error:

$$l_2 \left(y, \hat{y} \right) = \left( y - \hat{y} \right)^2$$

where $`\hat y`$ is the estimation of the model. We use loss to minimize errors and to fit model. 
Let‚Äôs dive into linear regression model.

### Linear regression

One of the most widely used, but not always effective algorithms for regression‚Äôs problem solution is linear 
regression model. Main goal of this model is to estimate the linear function of the training set with the least error.

We can fit this data using a simple linear regression model of the form 

$$f(x;\boldsymbol{\theta}) = b + \mathbf{w} x$$

where $$\mathbf{w}$$ is the slope, $$b$$ is the offset (or bias), and $$\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\mathbf{w}, b)$$ are all the parameters of the model. 
By adjusting $$\boldsymbol{\theta}$$, we can minimize the sum of squared errors until we find the least squares solution:

$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \arg \min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \text{MSE}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

$$\text{MSE}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( y_n - f(x_n; \boldsymbol{\theta})\right)^2$$

where MSE is mean squared error.

Lets deep with formal way, linear regression model could be wrote as:

$$f(x;\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b + \epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^D w_i x_i + b + \epsilon$$

where $$ \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$$ represents the inner or scalar product between the input vector $$\mathbf{x}$$ and the model's weight vector $$\mathbf{w}$$, $$b$$ is the offset (or bias), and $$\epsilon$$ is the residual error between our linear predictions and the true response.

From a mathematical point of view, we can define our task as minimizing MSE. 
To solve these problems we can use optimization methods such as gradient descent or Newton's method 
or even write down analytical solution that contain matrix inversion (after you will complete your first task, 
which we will discuss later in the chapter - you will find that matrix inversion is a heavy calculating operation). 
First task for you will be to find an analytical solution for the regression task.

### Gradient Descent

It is a common fact that gradient is the direction of fastest increase of function value and in the opposite case 
anti-gradient will show fastest decrease direction. Thus Gradient descent is about finding a local minimum of a 
differentiable function. And since our main goal in almost any machine learning task is to reduce the value of 
loss function gradient descent is perfectly fit for this needs.

To do it we should iteratively repeat next steps:

1. Calculate the value of gradient

    $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{\theta}} = \nabla L = \left( \begin{array}{c} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta_1} \\ \dots \\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta_n} \end{array} \right)$$

2. Update parameter values using formula:

    $$\boldsymbol{\theta}^{i+1} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^i - \gamma \nabla L \left( \boldsymbol{\theta}^i \right)$$
    
    Where $$\gamma$$ is the learning rate that defines how far we should go and where 0 is usually defined randomly.

![](misc/images/gradient_descent.jpg)

There are a lot of modifications of gradient descent for more accurate results and fast calculation. 
We consider primary modification ‚Äì stochastic gradient descent. Strong side of this method is that we stochastically 
choose one object (or batch of objects) and calculate gradient only on this object. It helps to save a lot of time, 
but qualitative efficiency doesn't have huge dropdowns. 

We recommend you to read about more modifications of GD such as Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam and momentum method, 
also you can read about secondary order methods like Newtons method.

### Overfitting and underfitting

A fundamental problem with MLE is that it will try to pick parameters that minimize loss on the training set, 
but this may not result in a model that has low loss on future data. This is called overfitting.

Thus when we fit highly flexible models, we need to be careful that we do not overfit the data, that is, 
we should avoid trying to model every minor variation in the input, since this is more likely to be noise than true signal. 
This is illustrated in the figure below, where we see that using a high degree polynomial results in a curve that is 
very ‚Äúwiggly‚Äù. It is unlikely that the true function has such extreme oscillations. Thus, using such a model might 
result in accurate predictions of future outputs

![](misc/images/graphics.jpg)

Underfitted model is the opposite to overfitted - the model that does not learn dependencies from training dataset 
or learn it in a wrong way. Which again results in poor performance on the test dataset. For example, we need to 
classify handwritten digits, and it happens that all images of 8‚Äôs have 67 dark pixels, while all other examples don‚Äôt. 
The model might decide to exploit this accidental regularity, thereby correctly classifying all the training examples 
of 8‚Äôs, without learning the true regularities. And when we pass some new images of 8‚Äôs that will be written with 
the other scale, we get very poor performance since the number of dark pixels will differ. The model does not 
learn required patterns.

In other words we need to fit the model balancing between these 2 cases. This is also known as bias-variance tradeoff. 
The error that we produce when fitting and evaluating the model can be splitted into 2 parts (actually 3, but we 
can‚Äôt influence on the third one): bias and variance. To understand what does every type of error means refer to 
figure from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff):

* ‚ÄúThe bias error is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance may result from an algorithm modeling the random noise in the training data (overfitting).‚Äù

Hopefully, the majority of models in machine learning deal with bias error and could have problems mainly with variance. 
But there are a lot of special techniques for reducing model overfitting. Here we want to introduce one of them 
that is called regularization. 

### Regularization

Usually the regularization comes from the fact that it simply consumes the additive in the loss function, 
which depends on the parameters of the model.

$$\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sum_{i=1}^N L \left( f(x_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}), y_i \right) + \lambda R(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

The idea of this addition is that the models do not seek to learn complex patterns and try to simplify the 
solution. In other words, if the model begins to overfit in the process of finding a solution, then the addition in 
the error function will begin to increase and this will force the model to stop training.

For linear regression, 2 variants of these additives are usually used:
* L2 - then the linear model is called the Ridge model 

    $$R(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \| \boldsymbol{\theta}\|_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^d \theta_i^2$$

* L1 - then the linear model is called Lasso model

    $$R(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \| \boldsymbol{\theta}\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^d |\theta_i|$$

* Sklearn has also a separate class when these 2 regularizations are combined and such a model is called Elastic

Think about how the algorithm will changes for finding a solution for a linear model if you add L1 and L2 
regularization to the loss function. Provide an answer inside your project.

### Quality metrics

Lets dive into quality metrics for regression problem estimation. We already have learned mean square error. 
And after research of definition  ‚Ñì1 regularization you already have known what is mean absolute error. 
But these metrics are not relative. What does it mean?

Let's imagine that we are solving a client income task, so our target variable is continuous. 
And our model‚Äôs MAE is equal to 5000. How could we estimate, is our model good enough?

Take a break and think for several minutes. Here we will discuss a few ways for this problem solution. 
First and  the simplest one compares our model with native forecasts. For example we could find the mean of our 
target variable and set it as a prediction for a test sample for a whole set of clients. And finally compare MAE 
of our model and native forecast. Here we recommend finding the best native forecast for MSE and MAE. 
Also think how we could improve native prediction for better quality. 

The second way we will discuss here is to reconstruct relative metrics to absolute ones. 
The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is one of the widely used regressive problem metrics. 
MAPE is the sum of the individual absolute errors divided by the demand (each period separately). 
It is the average of the percentage errors. Compared to MAE, MAPE has an exact range. 
For better understanding think out few examples and measure different metrics, also we recommend to define 
MSLE and R squared coefficient.

### Alternative linear regression problem formulation

Lets see on linear regression from the probability point of view and we can rewrite model with connection 
between linear regression and Gaussians in the following form:

![](misc/images/linear_regression_and_gaussian.jpg)

where  $`N(¬µ, \sigma^2)`$ is **Gaussian** or **normal** distribution with ¬µ is the **mean** and $`\sigma^2`$ is the **variance**.

This makes it clear that the model is a **conditional probability density**. 
In the simplest case, we assume ¬µ is a linear function of *x*, so $`¬µ= w^Tx`$, and that the noise is fixed, $`\sigma^2(x) = \sigma^2`$.

In this case, $`\theta = (w,\sigma^2)`$  are the **parameters** of the model. 

For example, suppose the input is 1 dimensional. We can represent the expected response as follows:

$`¬µ(x)= w_0+ w_1x = w^Tx`$

where $`w_0`$ is the intercept or bias term, $`w_1`$ is the slope, and where we have defined the vector *x = (1, x)*.

Let's try to find out how to determine parameters of the  linear regression model.

A common way to estimate the parameters of a statistical model is to compute the MLE - 
Maximum Likelihood Estimation. MLE is a method for estimating an unknown parameter by maximizing a 
Likelihood function, we can define it as: 

$`\hat \theta = arg \max\limits_{\theta} L(\theta) = arg \max\limits_{\theta} \prod_{i=1}^l P(y_i|x_i, \theta)`$

Where $`L(\theta)`$ ‚Äì Likelihood function.

It is common to assume the training examples are independent and identically distributed. 
This means we can write the log-likelihood as follows:

![](misc/images/log_likelihood.jpg)

Instead of maximizing the log-likelihood, we can equivalently minimize the negative log likelihood or NLL:

![](misc/images/nll.jpg)

The NLL formulation is sometimes more convenient, since many optimization software packages are designed to 
find the minima of functions, rather than maxima. Now let us apply the method of MLE to the linear regression 
setting. Inserting the definition of the Gaussian into the above, we find that the log likelihood is given by

![](misc/images/new_log_likelihood.jpg)

RSS stands for residual sum of squares and is defined by

![](misc/images/rss.jpg)

The RSS is also called the sum of squared errors, or SSE, and SSE/N is called the mean squared error or MSE. 
It can also be written as the square of the ‚Ñì2 norm of the vector of residual errors:

![](misc/images/sse.jpg)

Linear regression can be made to model non-linear relationships by 
replacing x with some non-linear function of the inputs, œÜ(x). That is, we use

![](misc/images/non_linear.jpg)

where could be degrees of features - ![](misc/images/feature_degrees.jpg)

Maximum likelihood estimation can result in overfitting. In some cases, our task ‚Äì minimizing RSS could have infinite solutions. 
Could you give us a few examples of such cases?  Take a break and think. Answer: 
So, several common cases for this problem ‚Äì high correlation features and cases when dimension of features more 
than dimension of object. Subsequently there are problems with the huge value of weights and overfitting. 
To solve this problem we can add regularization parameter for our minimizing equation. 
There are two basic regularization parameter ‚Ñì2 and ‚Ñì1. 

$`l2 = ||w||_2 = \sum_{l=1}^d w_i^2`$  
$`l1 = ||w||_1 = \sum_{l=1}^d |w_i|`$

From probability point of view, we can define regularization through MAP (Maximum A Posterior estimate) estimation 
with a zero-mean Gaussian prior on the weights, 

![](misc/images/ridge_regression.jpg)

This is called ridge regression. In more detail, we compute the MAP estimate as follows: 

![](misc/images/map.jpg)

> Source: [Kevin Murphy, Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)

is the ‚Ñì2 norm of the vector w. Thus we are penalizing weights that become too large in magnitude. 
In general, this technique is called ‚Ñì2 regularization or weight decay, and is very widely used.

In practice you can use logarithmic functions. We recommend you do this exercise and compare results. But don‚Äôt forget to perform inverse transformation when you will compare metrics.
    2. Next trick is outliers. The angle of the linear regression line strongly depends on outlier points. And often you should remove these points from !allert! only train data. You should explain why it was removed only from the train sample.  We recommend you do this exercise and compare results.
